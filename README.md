This repository is intended for anyone who wants to learn Java programming from scratch. It covers basic Java concepts and gradually moves on to advanced topics like OOP.

## Basic Java :beginner:

This section covers the fundamentals of Java programming, including variables, operators, and loops. Each concept is demonstrated with a simple Java code.

## Data Types :1234:

This section discusses the different data types in Java, including primitive data types and reference data types. It explains the characteristics and usage of each data type.

## Conditionals :left_right_arrow:

This section covers conditional statements in Java, including `if`, `if-else`, `switch`, and `ternary` operator. It explains how to use these statements to control the flow of a program.

## Arrays :arrow_right:

This section introduces arrays in Java. It explains how to declare, initialize, and manipulate arrays. It also covers multi-dimensional arrays.

## Strings :abc:

This section explains how to work with strings in Java. It covers string methods, string formatting, and string manipulation techniques.

## Methods :wrench:

This section covers methods in Java. It explains how to declare and call methods, and how to use method parameters and return values. It also discusses method overloading.

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) :books:

This section introduces OOP concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and encapsulation. Each concept is explained with a Java code example.
