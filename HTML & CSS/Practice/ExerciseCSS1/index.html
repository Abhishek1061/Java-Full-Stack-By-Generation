        <p class="paragraph">The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), sometimes called a panda bear or simply panda, is a bear species endemic to China1. It is characterized by its bold black-and-white coat and rotund body. Here are some interesting facts about pandas
            Pandas are probably the most easily recognized bear in the world due to their unique black and white fur. Despite their diet being over 99% bamboo, pandas are considered omnivores. They are known for their love of bamboo, eating up to 12 kilograms a day2!

            Pandas are a symbol of peace and good fortune in Chinese culture and have often served as Chinaâ€™s national symbol. They are a beloved animal worldwide and significant efforts have been made to protect their populations and habitats</p>
