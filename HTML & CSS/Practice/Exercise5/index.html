                    <strong>Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam,</strong> often hailed as the <strong>‘Missile Man of India’</strong>, was an esteemed aerospace scientist and the 11th President of India. Born on October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, he rose from humble beginnings to become a pivotal figure in India’s space and defense sectors. His significant contributions to the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology earned him the Bharat Ratna, India’s highest civilian honor. Dr. Kalam’s vision for India’s technological advancement and his inspirational books, such as <strong>“Wings of Fire,”</strong> have influenced generations. He passed away on July 27, 2015, leaving behind a legacy as a scientist, teacher, and a people’s president who continued to engage with students and the youth until his last moments. His life’s journey from a small island in South India to the Rashtrapati Bhavan is a testament to his indomitable spirit and enduring impact on Indian society and beyond.
