# Codecademy Learners Data Analysis ðŸ“Š

Welcome to the Codecademy Learners Data Analysis project! In this project, we'll be analyzing mockup data of Codecademy learners to gain insights into their learning patterns and behaviors.

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing data from two tables: `users` and `progress`. The `users` table contains information about learners, such as their user ID, email domain, country, and sign-up timestamp. The `progress` table tracks learners' progress in various courses, including CPP, SQL, HTML, JavaScript, and Java.

## Project Goals
Our goals for this project include:

1. Exploring the data using SQL queries and aggregate functions.
2. Identifying insights such as the top 25 schools (.edu domains), the number of .edu learners in New York, and the number of learners using the mobile app.
3. Utilizing the `strftime()` function in SQLite to analyze sign-up counts for each hour.
4. Performing table joins to delve deeper into the data, such as understanding course preferences among different schools and courses taken by learners in specific locations like New York and Chicago.

## Tasks Overview
### Prerequisites:
- Familiarity with SQL queries, aggregate functions, and multiple table joins.

### Project Requirements:
1. Explore the data using `SELECT *` from both tables and aggregate functions to understand the dataset.
2. Answer questions such as the top 25 schools (.edu domains), .edu learners in New York, and mobile app users.
3. Use the `strftime()` function to analyze sign-up counts for each hour.
4. Perform table joins to uncover insights like course preferences among different schools and courses taken by learners in specific locations.

## Setup Instructions
If you choose to work on this project, you can download the necessary files from this repository and use SQLite to run SQL commands.
